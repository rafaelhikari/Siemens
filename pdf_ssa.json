The device contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition on the device's web server by sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the web server port (tcp/80). The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to an affected device. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the availability of the device's web service. While the device itself stays operational, the web server responds with HTTP status code 404 (Not found) to any further request. A reboot is required to recover the web interface. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",

As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected products or modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining affected products, and recommends specific countermeasures until fixes are available. ",
            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Firmware variant IEC 61850 for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions < V4.33), Firmware variant PROFINET IO for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant Modbus TCP for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant DNP3 TCP for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant IEC104 for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions < V1.22). Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the EN100 communication module if oscillographs are running. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality. Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the EN100 module. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected EN100 modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",

Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote UpdateHandling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsitevisits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarifythe situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customernetwork with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect theirsystems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling.This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommend:- Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.- For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local SiemensHealthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends: - Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures. - For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations. In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends: - Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures. - For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

The update will be automatically available for customers with remote support. If no remote support is available or for questions regarding the update procedure, please contact customer service. The correct installation can be verified in the main syngo MR UI under 'Help -> Info', ensuring 'SecurityUpdate_SU28_F2 (SU28)' is listed under Siemens software packages. Until patches can be applied by the customer support and for end-of-support products, Siemens Healthineers recommends to isolate affected products that are listening on network ports 139/tcp, 445/tcp or 3389/tcp from any infected system within its respective network segment (e.g. by firewall blocking access to above network ports.) If the above cannot be implemented we recommend the following: - If patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the uninfected product from the network and use in standalone mode. - Reconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system. Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations. In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends: - Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures. - For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote UpdateHandling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsitevisits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarifythe situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customernetwork with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect theirsystems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling.This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends:- Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local SiemensHealthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

Until patches can be applied by the customer support and for end-of-support products, Siemens Healthineers recommends to isolate affected products that are listening on network ports 139/tcp, 445/tcp or 3389/tcp from any infected system within its respective network segment (e.g. by firewall blocking access to above network ports.) If the above cannot be implemented we recommend the following: - If patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the uninfected product from the network and use in standalone mode. - Reconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system. Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations. In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends: - Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures. - For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

If the above cannot be implemented we recommend the following: - If patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the uninfected product from the network and use in standalone mode. - Reconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system. Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.

Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.

The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the service to the network. All Siemens Healthineers products from all business lines have been evaluated. Most Siemens Healthineers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate the Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of Microsoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows. This advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.",

The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the service to the network.

Most Siemens Healthineers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate the Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of Microsoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows. This advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.",

The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the service to the network. All Siemens Healthineers products from all business lines have been evaluated. Most Siemens Healthineers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate the Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of Microsoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows. This advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.",

The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the service to the network.

Most Siemens Healthineers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate the Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of Microsoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows. This advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.",

Siemens has released updates for some affected products, is working on updates for the remaining affected products, and recommends specific countermeasures until fixes are available.",
            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Firmware variant IEC 61850 for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions < V4.35), Firmware variant MODBUS TCP for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant DNP3 TCP for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant IEC104 for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), Firmware variant Profinet IO for EN100 Ethernet module (All versions), SIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP300 and CP100 and the respective Ethernet communication modules (All versions < V7.82), SIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP200 and the respective Ethernet communication modules (All versions < V7.58). Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the affected products. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality of the affected devices. Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the affected products or modules. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected products or modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, and recommends that customers update to the new version. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures until patches are available.",
            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in IEC 61850 system configurator (All versions < V5.80), DIGSI 5 (affected as IEC 61850 system configurator is incorporated) (All versions < V7.80), DIGSI 4 (All versions < V4.93), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions < V8.11), SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions < V3.11), SICAM SCC (All versions < V9.02 HF3). A service of the affected products listening on all of the host's network interfaces on either port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service's client application on the host. In order to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to confidentiality and integrity of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.",

This includes HMI project cache folders of other configured WinCC OA servers. Precondition for this scenario is that an attacker tricks an app user to connect to an attacker-controlled WinCC OA server.",
            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for Android (All versions < V3.15.10), SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for iOS (All versions < V3.15.10). Insufficient limitation of CONTROL script capabilities could allow read and write access from one HMI project cache folder to other HMI project cache folders within the app's sandbox on the same mobile device. This includes HMI project cache folders of other configured WinCC OA servers. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to an attacker-controlled WinCC OA server. Successful exploitation requires user interaction and read/write access to the app's folder on a mobile device. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing data to the app's folder. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.",

An attacker with network access to port 80/TCP can change user-defined event properties without proper authorization. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with network access to the affected service. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation compromises integrity of the user-defined event properties and the availability of corresponding functionality. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",

The attacker must trigger the start of a new WLAN handshake in order to perform the attack. If WPA2- CCMP (AES) is configured on the devices  then attacks are limited to decryption and replay of parts of the network traffic. The attacker cannot join the Wireless network  or obtain the WPA2 key.    * SCALANCE WLC711 and WLC712 are only affected by the vulnerabilities related to the group key in the default configuration. An attacker is therefore not able to access unicast traffic. The devices are only affected by CVE-2017-13082 if they have 802.11r functionality activated. IEEE 802.11r is deactivated by default. The devices are only affected by the remaining vulnerabilities if the functions \"MeshConnex\" or 'Client Bridge Mode' are active. Both functions are disabled by default. If these modes have been activated and are not required for the operation of a wireless environment  then customers can deactivate the functionality to reduce the risk.    * SCALANCE W-700 devices that are operated in Client mode  SIMATIC Mobile Panel 277F IWLAN  and SIMATIC ET200 WLAN are not affected if the iPCF  iPCF-MC  or iPCF-HT features are enabled.    * SCALANCE W-700 devices operated in Access Point mode are only affected if WDS with WPA2 encryption is configured. If iPCF  iPCF-MC  or iPCF-HT is active on all interfaces  then SCALANCE W-700 devices are not vulnerable.    * RUGGEDCOM RX1400 and RS9xxW are not vulnerable if operated in Access Point mode.    * SCALANCE W1750D devices are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities in the default configuration. Only customers that enabled the \"Mesh\" or \"WiFi uplink\" functionality are affected by the vulnerabilities. Disabling these functionalities will completely mitigate the vulnerabilities.    * Ensure multiple layers of security  do not depend on the security of WPA2 alone.    * Use WPA2-CCMP (AES) instead of WPA2-TKIP or WPA-GCMP  if supported by the WLAN clients to reduce the risk of potential attacks    * Apply Defense-in-Depth https//www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security",

These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker within the radio range of the wireless network to decrypt, replay or inject forged network packets into the wireless communication. Several Siemens Industrial products use WPA/WPA2 and are therefore affected by some of the vulnerabilities.",

Improper certificate validation could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data from and write data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which allows intercepting the communication channel between the affected app and a server (such as Man-in-the-Middle). Furthermore, an attacker must be able to generate a certificate that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certificate. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server, impacting the communication's confidentiality and integrity. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.",

Siemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote UpdateHandling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsitevisits. Therefore customers of RUH capable equipment are recommended to clarifythe situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customernetwork with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to re-connect theirsystems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update Handling.This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends:- Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.- For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local SiemensHealthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.",

The vulnerabilities affect the web server of engineered HMIs and their internal password management. Possible attacks require either physical access to the HMI or an authenticated user, so an attacker must either have valid user credentials or must use social engineering on a legitimate user. When the vulnerabilities are exploited they allow password retrieval, web session hijacking, source code retrieval, display of false data and Denial-of-Service. Siemens addresses these issues by a new software version. ",

Restrict thefirewall configuration to allow as few network ports as possible.x OZW and OZS devices should switch off UPnP advertisement by selecting thefollowing menu options: Settings \u00c6 Communication \u00c6 Ethernet \u00c6 Localization functionsx Check the local network for any signs of unusual activity.x Visit the related customer support portal web page for more information (See Section 'Additional Resources').As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access toOZW and OZS products with appropriate mechanisms.

            "summary": "A vulnerability in the RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS) was recently publicly presented by a security researcher. ICS-CERT published an ALERT (12-234-01 Key Management Errors in RuggedCom's Rugged Operating System) on Aug.21, 2012 to advise the control system community.a The reported vulnerability can be used by an attacker to eavesdrop and decrypt HTTPS/SSL traffic or SSH traffic between a user (administrator) and a RuggedCom ROS device. In addition, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is possible and an attacker could use intercepted data to compromise the device. Further analysis by RuggedCom has revealed that similar vulnerabilities apply to the ROX (ROX I and ROX II) operating system firmware and the RuggedMax operating system firmware. A fix for the identified vulnerability in ROX is already available. For the SSH service of RuggedMax a temporary fix for the identified vulnerability is also available.",
